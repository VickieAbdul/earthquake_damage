# Earthquake Damage in Nepal
Nepal is prone to earthquakes, which can cause severe damage to buildings and infrastructure. Accurate prediction of earthquake damage can help in disaster preparedness and reduce the impact of future earthquakes.

This project focuses on the Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. It aims to analyze earthquake data and create a model to predict the level of building damage. The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

2. Task 2:-Create a predictive model in such a way that the objective is to predict the ordinal variable “damage_grade”. This column presents the level of damage grade affected by the earthquake.

3. Task3:-Suggestions to the Seismologists to avoid  earthquake event leading  to significant damage in many buildings.
